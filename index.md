# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how I am trying
to get a career in science using Python, Data science techniques
and Software development.

**It** took me a while and a lot of trying things that I liked and didn't like.
I enjoyed things but I was entirely occupied by other things that I couldn't
recognize my passion.

I programmed with C++, C#, .NET, javascript, I styled pages with HTML and CSS.
But it wasn't till I met Python.

I don't even remember how that happened, but I am glad it did.
